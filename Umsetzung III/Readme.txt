This application, created by Florin Rüedi, is provided free of charge and may be freely distributed. 
It was initially developed as a school project and has since been refined to its current state.

While the application is offered without any cost, if you find it valuable and wish to express your appreciation, 
you are welcome to make a voluntary donation. Your support would be greatly appreciated.

A user manual titled "Anleitung" is available in the folder of the application which is most likely 'Programme(x86)/Rueedi Ltd/Unihockey Spielanzeige'
The user manual should explain the usage of this app in detail.
Additionally the font 'Urbanist' must also be installed for better Display. The font is also located in the folder of the application in a seperate
Folder called 'Urbanist'. Open this folder, select all files, right-click and press 'Install'.
To adjust the logo of the application you have to start the Spielanzeige as 'Administrator'. Hold 'Shift' and right-click the app. Then select 
'start as administrator'. After the application has started press 'Ctrl' and 'L' and a dialog opens where you can select your desired logo.

For assistance or feedback, please feel free to contact me at florinruedi@gmail.com.


Thank you for using this application, and your generosity is always appreciated.
